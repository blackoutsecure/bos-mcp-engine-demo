# Blackout Secure MCP Engine Demo

This repo is a minimal, public-facing example of how to define MCP server metadata and generate a static registry using the Blackout Secure MCP Registry Engine GitHub Action.

## What this repo demonstrates

- Defining MCP servers under `servers/<name>/server.json`
- Versioned metadata under `servers/<name>/versions/<version>.json`
- Generating static registry output for static hosting platforms
- Keeping examples small and easy to understand

## Project layout

```
servers/
  echo-demo/
    server.json
    versions/
      1.0.0.json
  filesystem-demo/
    server.json
    versions/
      1.0.0.json
```

## How the registry is generated

The static registry is generated by the GitHub Marketplace action:

- https://github.com/marketplace/actions/blackout-secure-mcp-registry-engine

The action implementation lives at:

- https://github.com/blackoutsecure/bos-mcp-registry-engine

## Notes

- This is a demo registry. Do not treat it as production or internal content.
- The registry engine itself is not implemented here.
- JSON files follow MCP registry schema conventions.

## Contributing

Keep changes focused on clear, public examples. If you add a new server example:

- Add a `server.json`
- Add at least one version file under `versions/`
- Keep metadata public and accessible
